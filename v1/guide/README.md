## General

Simple Business Manager is designed & developed to suit most of the business needs. We have tried to keep design and layout simple so that that everyone can easily get going. The design is responsive as we have added the progressive web app feature to it. SBM look quite fine on all screen sizes.

You can change the main menus position from settings, it could be on top or left sidebar.

All the tables are filter-able/search-able/sort-able with responsive styles, on the small screens, you can scroll to left to see data.

## Dashboard

Dashboard has 3 charts at this moment.

The pie chart shows the current month's creations expenses, incomes, invoices and purchases. Other 2 overview charts show the monthly and yearly total invoices and purchases amounts. You can change the month & year to display that month & year data.

We would like to listen your feedback to improve and make dashboard more informative.

## Calendar / Events

Calendar UI is simple & easy, you can add events and they will be displayed on calendar. User will get email notification before 2 days and 1 day of the event.

## Activity Logs

SMA will automatically logs all the activity in your app for super-admins only.
