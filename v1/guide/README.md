## General

Tailor Shop Management System is designed & developed to suit the general tailor shop business needs. We have tried to keep design and layout simple so that that everyone can easily get going. The design is responsive as we have added the progressive web app feature to it. TSMS look quite fine on all screen sizes.

All the tables are filter-able/& search-able with responsive styles, on the small screens, you can scroll to left to see data.

## Dashboard

Dashboard has the Orders, Salaries, Expenses (total amount and number of record) and New Customer for the last 30 days.

In the middle there are 2 charts for month & year overview of the orders, salaries and expenses. Month chart show the sum of the day while year chart show the sum for whole month. You can choose the month and year for charts to load the relative data. The charts are graphical representation of the day's and month's total revenue and expense. Charts have legend at bottom to enable/disable any field order, salary or expense.

The last section of the dashboard has today's order and the list of order that need to be delivered today.

We would like to listen your feedback to improve and make dashboard more informative.

## Activity Logs

TSMS will automatically logs all the activity in your app for owner to review or audit any case.
